## apt and apt-get

- Q: what is the difference between apt and apt-get in ubuntu command.
- A:
	- Both apt and apt-get are command-line tools used to manage software packages in Ubuntu and other Debian-based Linux distributions. However, they have some differences in their usage and functionality:

	1. Simpler command syntax: The apt command provides a simpler and more user-friendly syntax for managing packages. It combines the most commonly used functions of apt-get and apt-cache in a single command. For example, to install a package with apt, you would use the command sudo apt install <package-name> instead of sudo apt-get install <package-name>.

	2. Improved dependency handling: The apt command has improved dependency handling compared to apt-get. It automatically resolves and installs all necessary dependencies for a package, whereas apt-get may require additional commands to install missing dependencies.

	3. More informative output: apt provides more informative and detailed output during package management operations. It includes progress bars and color-coded messages that make it easier to understand what is happening.

	4. Advanced features: apt-get still provides some advanced features that are not available in apt. For example, apt-get supports more command-line options and can be used for package management tasks such as purging packages and installing from specific sources.

	- Overall, apt is a newer, more user-friendly command that provides an easier and more streamlined experience for managing packages. However, for more advanced users or for specific package management tasks, apt-get may still be the preferred tool.

- Q: what is these 2 commands. apt install software-properties-common -y, add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
- A:
	- apt install software-properties-common -y is a command used to install the software-properties-common package using the apt package manager. The software-properties-common package provides a set of common utilities for adding and managing software repositories on Ubuntu and other Debian-based Linux distributions. The -y option is used to automatically answer "yes" to any prompts that may appear during the installation process, without requiring user input.

	- add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa is a command used to add the deadsnakes/ppa Personal Package Archive (PPA) to the list of repositories used by the apt package manager. PPAs are third-party software repositories that can be used to install additional software packages that are not available in the official Ubuntu repositories. In this case, the deadsnakes/ppa PPA contains updated versions of Python packages. After adding the PPA to the list of repositories, you can use the apt package manager to install packages from the PPA using the standard sudo apt install <package-name> command.
