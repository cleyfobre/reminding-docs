## https default port: 443

- The default port for HTTPS (HTTP Secure) is port 443. This is because HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP that encrypts the data being transmitted between a client (such as a web browser) and a server. In order to establish a secure connection, a client needs to connect to a server using a secure port that is not commonly used by other protocols or services.

- Port 443 is designated as the standard secure port for HTTP traffic, and it is used by default for HTTPS traffic. When a client initiates an HTTPS connection to a server, the server sends its SSL/TLS certificate to the client, and the client verifies the certificate to ensure that it is valid and issued by a trusted Certificate Authority. Once the certificate is verified, the client and server use it to establish an encrypted connection over port 443.

- In summary, port 443 is designated as the standard secure port for HTTPS traffic because it provides a secure channel for transmitting data between a client and a server over the internet.
