For load testing your Python program in a controlled, resource-limited environment while also logging and analyzing performance in real-time, here's a structured approach:

### 1. **Isolated Environment with Limited Resources**

To create an isolated environment and limit the resources used by your program, you can leverage the following tools:

- **Docker**: Create a container that restricts CPU and memory usage.
  - You can use Docker to isolate your Python program in a container and limit resources by configuring the CPU and memory constraints. Here's a basic example:
  
    ```bash
    docker run -d --cpus="1.0" --memory="512m" my-python-program
    ```

    - `--cpus="1.0"`: Limits the container to use only 1 CPU.
    - `--memory="512m"`: Limits the container's memory usage to 512 MB.

- **Linux cgroups (Control Groups)**: If you're on a Linux system, you can directly use `cgroups` to limit CPU, memory, and I/O for a process.
  - Install `cgroup-tools` and create a group with limited resources.

    ```bash
    cgcreate -g cpu,memory:/mygroup
    cgset -r cpu.shares=512 /mygroup
    cgset -r memory.limit_in_bytes=512M /mygroup
    ```

    Then, run your Python program in that control group:

    ```bash
    cgexec -g cpu,memory:/mygroup python my_program.py
    ```

### 2. **Random Data Generation**

To generate random data and send it to your Python program, you can create a script to simulate random input data, either from an API or from internal data structures.

For random data from an external API:
```python
import random
import time
import requests

def get_random_data():
    # Simulate random API response
    random_data = {
        "id": random.randint(1, 1000),
        "value": random.random(),
        "timestamp": time.time()
    }
    return random_data

while True:
    data = get_random_data()
    response = requests.post("http://localhost:5000/receive", json=data)
    time.sleep(random.uniform(0.5, 2))  # Simulate random intervals
```

This script simulates sending random data at random intervals to your program.

### 3. **Real-Time Performance Logging**

To measure the delay between when the data is sent from the API (or simulated data) and when it is processed by your program, you can use timestamps. Here's how you can integrate this into your program:

- **Record Timestamps**: When the data is received by the Saver program, log the time along with the original timestamp from the data itself.
  
Example in Python:

```python
import time
import logging

logging.basicConfig(filename='performance.log', level=logging.INFO)

def process_data(data):
    # Data contains a timestamp field when it was sent
    sent_time = data.get("timestamp")
    receive_time = time.time()

    # Calculate delay
    delay = receive_time - sent_time

    # Log the delay
    logging.info(f"Data ID: {data['id']}, Sent Time: {sent_time}, Received Time: {receive_time}, Delay: {delay} seconds")

    # Process and save to DB (simulate)
    time.sleep(0.2)  # Simulating processing delay
    logging.info(f"Data ID: {data['id']} processed successfully.")
```

### 4. **Monitoring and Analyzing Performance**

To analyze how well your program is performing, you can:

- **Real-Time Logging**: Using `logging` as shown above to log delays and processing times in real time.
- **Time Metrics**: Measure time on sending and receiving the data and compute the total delay.

For more detailed performance analysis, you can:

- **Time for Send/Receive**: Use `time.time()` or `datetime` module to log exact timestamps for when data is sent and received.
- **Resource Monitoring**: Use tools like `htop` or `docker stats` to monitor resource usage during the load test.

### 5. **Real-Time Load Testing with Python**

You can use the `concurrent.futures` library or tools like `locust` to perform concurrent load testing on your Python program.

Example using `concurrent.futures`:
```python
import time
import requests
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def send_random_data():
    data = {"id": random.randint(1, 1000), "value": random.random(), "timestamp": time.time()}
    response = requests.post("http://localhost:5000/receive", json=data)
    return response.status_code

def load_test(num_requests):
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:
        futures = [executor.submit(send_random_data) for _ in range(num_requests)]
        for future in futures:
            print(future.result())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    start_time = time.time()
    load_test(100)  # Simulate 100 random data requests
    print(f"Load test completed in {time.time() - start_time} seconds")
```

### Summary
- **Isolation**: Use Docker or cgroups to create an isolated environment and limit the resources for your Python program.
- **Random Data**: Generate random data with timestamps to simulate API responses and measure how fast it is processed.
- **Real-Time Performance Logging**: Log send and receive times and calculate delays to track how fast your program is processing data.
- **Load Testing**: Use multithreading or external tools like `locust` for concurrent testing while tracking the program's performance in real-time.

This setup will allow you to control resources, load test your program, and analyze its performance in real time.
