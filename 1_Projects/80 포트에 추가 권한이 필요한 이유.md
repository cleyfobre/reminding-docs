In Linux, ports below 1024 are known as "privileged ports" or "well-known ports." By default, only processes with root privileges can bind to these ports. This requirement exists for several reasons:

1. **Security:**
	- **Preventing Unauthorized Services:** By restricting the ability to bind to these ports to root or highly privileged users, Linux helps prevent unauthorized or malicious users from running critical network services (e.g., web servers, FTP servers) on these well-known ports.
	- **Service Authenticity:** Users can trust that services running on these ports are managed by authorized administrators. For example, if you connect to port 80 on a server, you can be reasonably sure that it's an authorized web server if only root can start services on that port.
	
2. **Historical Reasons:**
    - The concept of privileged ports comes from the early days of UNIX, where it was important to ensure that only trusted services could bind to the ports used by critical applications. This tradition has continued in modern Linux systems for compatibility and security reasons.
