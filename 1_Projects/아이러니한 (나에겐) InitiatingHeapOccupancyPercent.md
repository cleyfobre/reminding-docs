#gc #InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent #IHOP

IHOP을 낮게 했을 때 왜 더 많음 Committed Heap이 Allocate되는지 이해가 안감... 아래 챗느님 답변 복습해야 함...

**IHOP이 40일 때, 3시간, 하루치 그래프**
이게 GIGC가 맞는지도 잘 모르겠네. G1GC라면 jstat 명령어로 봤을 때, CGC 가 올라가야 하는 거 아닌가. YGC가 올라가던데. `jstat -gc 61997 10000`

#todo 
In Java, the `-XX:InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent` option controls the threshold at which the JVM will start considering a garbage collection (GC) cycle in the context of the **Concurrent Mark-Sweep (CMS)** garbage collector or the **G1 garbage collector**.

Here’s why the committed heap size behaves differently when you change this threshold:

1. **Committed Size**: This is the amount of memory the JVM has allocated for the heap. It can grow independently of the heap usage and depends on how much memory the JVM has requested from the operating system for the heap.

2. **InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent**: This setting determines when the **Concurrent Mark Phase** (in CMS) or the **Mark Phase** (in G1) will start. It’s a percentage of the **used heap** before the JVM triggers this phase. Reducing this threshold means that the JVM will trigger the GC cycle sooner, with less heap usage.

### Explanation:
- When you set `-XX:InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent=40`, the JVM will initiate the GC when 40% of the heap is used. As a result, the heap size (committed size) remains smaller because the GC happens relatively later, and the JVM doesn't need to allocate as much memory upfront.
- When you set `-XX:InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent=20`, the GC triggers earlier, when only 20% of the heap is used. Since this triggers the GC cycle sooner, the JVM may request a larger heap to ensure it has enough memory available for the GC to work, especially if the application might require more memory to handle peak workloads, leading to a larger **committed heap size**.

### Why Committed Size is Larger with a Smaller Threshold:
- **Earlier GC triggers more memory allocation**: With a lower threshold (like 20%), the JVM may prefer to allocate more memory early on to avoid running out of memory or causing performance issues, hence the higher committed size (600 MB in your case). 
- **Memory Overhead for GC**: A smaller threshold means the JVM expects to perform GC earlier and might need more memory to handle the temporary overhead during GC operations. Therefore, it requests more heap memory to manage the process effectively.

This behavior is largely dependent on the JVM's internal memory management strategy. The JVM may decide to allocate more committed memory when it anticipates that more memory might be needed during frequent GC cycles, leading to a larger committed size, even if the heap usage hasn't reached the higher threshold you initially set.
